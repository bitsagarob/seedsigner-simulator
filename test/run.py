"""
Run the whole suite: one command, from a fresh clone.

    python3 test/run.py                 everything
    python3 test/run.py scan            only the tests whose name contains "scan"

It builds what is missing, generates the QR videos, starts the server, runs the
tests against it, and stops the server whether they passed or not.

Prerequisites, and nothing else:
  - Python 3.9+
  - pip install playwright && playwright install chromium
  - build/fetch-assets.sh and build/build-wallet-zip.sh able to run once, which
    needs network access. Their outputs are not committed: the Pyodide runtime is
    26MB of someone else's release, and wallet.zip is built from a pinned
    upstream SeedSigner commit so that what is tested is provably that commit.

Order is deliberate. The checks that need nothing run first and finish in
seconds, so a broken checkout says so before anything spends two minutes booting
CPython in WebAssembly.

# and read down two different decoder paths, so if the wallet is honest all three
# runs end on the same rendered fingerprint. Comparing the images turns a claim
# somebody had to check by eye into something CI can fail on.
#
# What is compared is the device's own canvas -- the 320x240 SeedSigner's
# renderer drew, read back out of it by the scan tests -- and not the page
# screenshots sitting next to it in the same directory. A screenshot of the page
# also holds the title, the amber warning box, the tray labels and the hint line,
# every one of them drawn with the fonts the machine happens to have and not one
# of them anything wallet.zip can influence. Comparing those went red on innocent
# hosts: once on a font difference across the whole header, once on five pixels
# differing by one channel value at an antialiased corner of the warning box,
# while the device area was byte-identical both times. A check that fails for
# reasons nobody caused is one people learn to skim past, and that is how a real
# regression eventually gets waved through.
#

# firmwares draw SeedFinalizeScreen differently. Stock offers one passphrase

# and never will be, and a single baseline could only be satisfied by one of
# them. The seed behind both is the same seed, and the fingerprint printed on
