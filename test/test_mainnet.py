"""Mainnet, on purpose: the keys the wallet exports and a signature it makes.

The simulator starts on Testnet and the page shouts when anybody moves it to
Mainnet, because a seed typed into a browser tab has no secure element and any
mainnet key derived from it should be treated as public. That warning is only
honest if mainnet actually works here, and until this file existed nobody had
checked. This is that check, and it costs nothing: no coins, no network, no
broadcast, and a seed that has been published in SeedSigner's own documentation
for years.

Two claims, both about mainnet, both anchored outside the wallet.

**Derivation.** With the device set to Mainnet through its own Settings and
Advanced menus, the test scans the published test seed and exports an account key
through the wallet's own Export Xpub screens, at both standard mainnet paths: the
multisig one, m/48'/0'/0'/2', and the single sig one, m/84'/0'/0'. What the wallet
puts on the screen is read back out of the QR it drew, and compared with a key
derived in mainnet_reference.py, which is BIP39, BIP32 and SLIP-132 written out
from the specifications with nothing but hashlib underneath. That file never
imports embit and never opens wallet.zip; the wallet does all of its work with
embit. Two implementations that share no code have to agree on the fingerprint
and on all 111 characters of the extended key, or this fails.

**Signing.** The test then fabricates a mainnet transaction: an invented UTXO on a
transaction that does not exist, spent to an invented recipient. It goes in by
camera as a base64 PSBT, exactly as one would from a coordinator, and the wallet
is driven through its own review and approve screens. The signed PSBT comes back
out as the animated QR the wallet displays, and the signature in it is verified
here against a BIP143 sighash computed from the transaction the test built, with
an ECDSA verifier written out in the same reference file. Nothing is broadcast,
and nothing could be: the input it spends has never existed.

What this does not establish: that the simulator is safe to put a real seed into.
It is not, and proving that mainnet signing works correctly is precisely what
makes that worth saying loudly. A signature made in a browser tab from a seed
typed into that tab is a signature anybody who has seen the tab could have made.

The camera is fed the way every other scan test here feeds it, from a generated
y4m file, with one addition: the reel is changed between scans. Chromium reopens
the file each time a stream starts (measured, not assumed), so replacing it
between two scans is what holding up a different QR looks like from the wallet's
side. The wallet cannot tell the difference and is never told which reel is up.

Smartcard firmware only. Both firmwares carry the same embit and derive the same
keys from the same seed, and neither the export screens nor the signing path is
smartcard code, so running this twice would double the runtime and prove the same
thing twice.
