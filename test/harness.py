"""
Shared plumbing for the tests: where to point them, and how to read the wallet's
own log.

The log is the oracle for almost everything here. The wallet narrates every
screen it puts up ("display() enter: <ScreenName>"), the camera says which
decoder it chose, and the simulated card layer says which card the Python side
saw. Asserting on those lines is a statement about what the wallet actually did,
which a screenshot is not.

The page reads that narration itself now and so always asks the worker for it,
but only ?debug=1 puts it on the console, which is where these tests read it
from, so wallet_url() always adds it. Without it every test in this suite would
sit and time out against a wallet that is working perfectly.
