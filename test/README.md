# Tests

The simulator runs unmodified SeedSigner firmware under Pyodide, with four
hardware seams faked from outside it. These tests exist to check the seams,
because that is where a browser port can quietly start lying: a camera that
reports a QR nobody held up, a card reader that hands over the wrong card.

Everything here reads the wallet's own log as its oracle. The wallet narrates
every screen it puts up (`display() enter: SeedFinalizeScreen`), the camera says
which decoder it chose, and the simulated card layer says which card the Python
side saw. Asserting on those lines is a statement about what the wallet actually
did; a screenshot is not. That narration only happens when the page is loaded
with `?debug=1`, which is why every URL the tests build carries it.

## Running them

Prerequisites:

    pip install playwright==1.47.0
    playwright install chromium

Then, from a fresh clone:

    python3 test/run.py

That builds what is missing, generates the QR videos, starts a server, runs
everything against it, and stops the server afterwards. The first run also
downloads the Pyodide runtime and builds both wallet zips from their pinned
upstream commits, which takes a few minutes; later runs reuse all of it.

A subset, by substring on the step name -- the names are `leak_scan`, `cards`,
`tray_layout`, `device`, `firmware`, `build_info`, `settings`, `scan_seedqr`, `scan_compact`,
`scan_native`, `stock_scan_seedqr`, `stock_scan_compact`, `stock_scan_native`,
`cards_browser`, `cards_seed`, `cards_seedkeeper`, `cards_descriptor`, `mainnet`:

    python3 test/run.py scan          # everything with "scan" in the name
    python3 test/run.py stock         # the three stock-firmware scans

The three scan tests run once per firmware: the smartcard fork the simulator has
always run, and stock SeedSigner. The card tests are smartcard only, because the
menus they drive do not exist in stock. `SIM_FIRMWARE` picks the firmware for a
single test file run by hand; `test_firmware.py` ignores it and visits both by
name, because switching between them is what it is about.

    python3 test/run.py leak          # just the leak scanner
    python3 test/run.py cards tray    # the smartcard side only

Individual files run on their own too, against a server you start yourself:

    python3 test/serve.py --port 8770 src/web src/shims build/out &
    python3 test/make_qr_y4m.py
    python3 test/test_scan.py

Screenshots land in `test/artifacts/`. So do the QR videos, which `run.py`
deletes afterwards because they are 160MB and regenerate in seconds; set
`SIM_KEEP_VIDEOS=1` to keep them.

| variable | default | what it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SIM_PORT` | `8770` | port the test server listens on |
| `SIM_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:$SIM_PORT` | where the tests look for the simulator |
| `SIM_ARTIFACT_DIR` | `test/artifacts` | screenshots and videos |
| `SIM_ASSETS` | `build/out`, `src/web` | where `wallet.zip` and `pyodide/` are |
| `QR_KIND` | `qr` | which QR `test_scan.py` holds up: `qr` or `qr-compact` |

`SIM_URL` is the useful one: point it at a deployed copy and the same tests prove
the page that is actually serving people decodes a QR, rather than that its files
return 200.

## What each test proves

**`leak_scan.py`**: no tracked file names the author's infrastructure: no
private or CGNAT address, no absolute home directory, no hostname that resolves
only on one LAN. A public repository should not publish its author's server
layout, and a human checking that once does not scale to every future commit.
Public URLs are deliberately untouched. The allowlist is at the top of the file
and every entry says why it is there.

**`test_cards.py`**: drives the pyscard stand-in in `src/smartcard` directly, no
browser: three distinct cards with distinct UIDs, an empty reader that raises
rather than inventing a card, state that survives a trip out of the reader, and
the right state published back to the tray. Then a seed: refused before the PIN
is verified, refused if it is too short, refused a second time, and once accepted,
answering with keys that pysatochip's own `CardDataParser` (read out of
`wallet.zip`, so it is the copy the browser runs) recovers a public key from.
The card's `m/84'/0'/0'` has to equal the same seed derived outside it, and its
master fingerprint has to be the test vector's. Then the SeedKeeper half: a
masterseed and a 448-character 2 of 3 multisig descriptor stored, listed,
exported and checked against pysatochip's own header parser, the export rights
of each enforced by the card, and the space each costs compared with upstream's
own `calculate_seedkeeper_secret_size`. Two seconds, and it says why the browser
tests failed before either has finished booting.

**`test_tray_layout.py`**: the card tray as a control: three cards side by side
at a narrow viewport with no horizontal scrollbar, the accent and lift that show
which card is in, one card in the reader at a time, and Enter on a focused card
inserting it *without* also reaching the wallet's key handler underneath.

**`test_device.py`**: the device art as a control, on a phone. Two claims, and
neither of them needs the wallet, so this file costs seconds.

The screen is not a button. It used to be the select key, on the grounds that it
is the biggest target on the shell, and on a phone that meant a tap anywhere on
the home menu opened the camera. A SeedSigner has no touchscreen, so neither has
this. The proof is a second device rendered on the page with an `onKey` that only
counts, driven by real touch events through the DevTools protocol: a tap on the
screen counts nothing, a tap on a key counts exactly one -- not two, which is
what a device answering both the pointer event and the mouse event the browser
synthesises afterwards would count -- a finger held for two seconds still counts
one, because a hardware button does not repeat, and two fingers landing together
count one.

Then the size of those keys. A landscape shell fitted to a 360 pixel phone draws
them 21 pixels across, which is not a thumb target, so the page offers the device
the whole viewport and lays it along the phone's long side: upright it is turned
across the screen, sideways it is height-bound, and the keys are about 46 pixels
either way. Both orientations are checked and photographed, along with the
wallet's own screen staying 4:3 and unstretched in both, since what the scan
tests compare is that canvas.

**`test_firmware.py`**: the firmware switch, and what the page claims while it is
on each one. Two firmwares are built and the page runs one of them, which decides
what it can honestly show: the sentence under the device has to name the running
firmware and call the fork a fork, the switch has to actually come back on the
other one with the rest of the query string intact, and the card tray has to be
**absent** under stock rather than disabled or greyed, because stock has no card
code for a tray to control. Nothing here waits for the wallet to boot, so it
costs seconds.

**`test_build_info.py`**: the technical details panel, and the one check the page
makes about itself. The panel is where a visitor is told what is running, so
every value in it is compared here against something that is not the panel's own
source: the tag, the commit and both hashes against `UPSTREAM`, the Pyodide
version against `build/fetch-assets.sh`, and the dependency list against the
licences manifest inside the built zip. The sha256 the panel shows for the zip
the page received is the worker's hash of the bytes it fetched, so it is compared
against the zip on disk, for both firmwares.

Then the part that makes it a check rather than a decoration: a copy of the zip
with one byte appended is served from a second server, in front of the real one,
and the panel has to say the two hashes differ and show the altered file's own
hash. `build/out` is never touched, so there is nothing to put back if this fails
halfway. The limitation line is asserted too, because a page that quietly stopped
saying the self-check is not proof would be claiming more than it can.

**`test_settings.py`**: a setting changed through the wallet's own menus, and the
network indicator that follows it. It exists because changing a setting did not
work and nothing here noticed: `Settings.save()` debounces its write behind a
`threading.Timer`, the worker shimmed `Thread` but not `Timer`, and every change
died on a System Error. Then, once the Timer ran inline, it ran inside the lock
`save()` holds while scheduling it and the wallet wedged after storing the value,
which is why one of the checks is that the wallet drew again afterwards. It also
pins the starting network down: a fresh page comes up on **Testnet**, which is
`settings.json` and not a patch, and going to Mainnet through Settings > Advanced
is what makes the page say so loudly and stop offering our own test network.

**`test_scan.py`**: the whole scan path against Chromium's fake camera, run
twice. `qr.y4m` is the digit-based SeedQR; `qr-compact.y4m` is the raw-bytes
CompactSeedQR, which is the case that breaks first if any layer decides a payload
is text. Both encode the same seed, so both must reach `SeedFinalizeScreen` on
the same fingerprint. Both videos open on blank frames, and the test asserts
nothing is decoded during them.

**`test_scan_native.py`**: the `BarcodeDetector` branch, which the plain scan
test never reaches because desktop Chromium ships no Shape Detection API. A stub
detector is installed before any page script runs, and it always claims a QR and
always returns rubbish for `rawValue`, which is not artificial, since a real
`BarcodeDetector` handed a CompactSeedQR returns mojibake either way.

Two phases, and the first is the point of the file: **camera pointed at a blank
wall, native claiming a QR on every frame, and the wallet must load nothing at
all.** An earlier version fell back to `rawValue` here and reached a real-looking
fingerprint, `17d9884b`, from pure garbage: a seed that was never in front of
the camera. If that phase ever passes by reporting a seed, the simulator is
inventing keys, which is the worst thing a bitcoin-adjacent tool can do. The
second phase then holds up a real CompactSeedQR and requires the correct seed
anyway, because jsQR re-reads the frame for its actual bytes.

**`run.py`'s `same_seed` step**, once per firmware: after the scan tests, the
screen each of that firmware's three runs ended on is compared byte for byte with
the other two, and then with a committed baseline. One seed, encoded three ways
and read down two different decoder paths, must end on one rendered fingerprint.
It has been identical across every run so far, including runs against differently
built wallet zips, so a difference means something real changed.

What is compared is `scan-screen-*.png`: the 320x240 canvas SeedSigner's own
renderer drew, read back out of the canvas rather than photographed. The
whole-page `scan-proof-*.png` screenshots are still written and are the thing to
look at when this fails, but they are not what is asserted on. A page screenshot
also holds the title, the amber warning box, the tray labels and the hint line,
all drawn with whatever fonts the machine has and none of them anything
`wallet.zip` can influence, so comparing those went red on hosts where nothing
was wrong: once on a font difference across the whole header, once on five pixels
differing by one channel value at an antialiased corner of the warning box while
the device area was byte-identical.

Agreeing with each other is not enough; three runs of a wallet that derived the
seed wrongly would agree perfectly. The anchor is a committed capture of
`SeedFinalizeScreen` showing the BIP39 test vector's master fingerprint
`b2269592`, and there is one per firmware because the two draw that screen
differently: stock offers one passphrase button where the fork offers three, so
the images can never be the same and a single baseline could only ever be
satisfied by one of them. The seed behind both is the same seed, and the
fingerprint on both is `b2269592`. Both are committed as pictures rather than as
digests so that the anchor can be audited by opening it. Regenerate one only when
the wallet is meant to draw something different, or when the Chromium that
encodes the PNG changes underneath it:

    python3 test/run.py scan
    cp test/artifacts/scan-screen-qr.png test/baseline/screen-b2269592.png

    python3 test/run.py stock_scan
    cp test/artifacts/stock-scan-screen-qr.png test/baseline/stock-screen-b2269592.png

and look at the file before committing it. A baseline nobody read anchors
nothing.

**`test_passphrase.py`**: the BIP39 passphrase changes the key, not just the
screen. The published test mnemonic goes in by camera twice, in fresh browser
contexts: once with no passphrase, once with `abc` entered through the firmware's
own Type Passphrase keyboard. The wallet's log has to announce the keyboard,
return exactly the typed passphrase, reach the review screen and then finalize
the seed. Both runs export a single-sig native Segwit account at `m/84'/1'/0'`,
on the simulator's default Testnet, through the wallet's own Export Xpub screens.

Screen names prove the route, not the key. The static QR the wallet draws is read
back and compared, origin and every character of the `vpub`, against
`mainnet_reference.py`, which derives both answers independently with and without
the passphrase. Both fingerprints must match their respective reference roots
and differ from each other; the account keys must differ too, not just the origin
labels. A wallet that silently ignores the passphrase cannot pass by reaching a
convincing-looking review screen.

Smartcard firmware only, one ASCII passphrase and one account path. This does not
check Unicode normalization, every keyboard layout, editing or discarding a
passphrase, scanning one, loading one from a card, or signing with the resulting
key. Nothing here makes a browser safe for real seeds; this mnemonic and
passphrase are public test inputs and nothing derived from them should hold value.

**`test_cards_browser.py`**: the same card story as `test_cards.py`, but through
`wallet.html` and the real tray: an empty reader ends in a warning rather than a
hang, Card A reaches the Python side with Card A's UID, Card B with a different
one, and Card A put back is still the same card. The UID in the log is the one
pysatochip derived from the APDUs the card answered, so it is evidence about what
the wallet saw rather than about what was clicked.

**`test_cards_seed.py`**: the whole save-a-seed path through the wallet's own
screens: initialise a blank card with a PIN, scan the BIP39 test vector, hand it
to the card, then come back later (new connector, new applet selection, new PIN)
and read extended keys back off it into a wallet descriptor. Two independent
oracles: the card announces the master fingerprint it derived, which has to be
the vector's `b2269592`, and the wallet announces the screens it reached, where
`SeedExportXpubDetailsScreen` is only reachable if pysatochip recovered the right
key from *both* signatures on *every* answer, since it raises otherwise.

One of its checks asserts a bug on purpose. At the pinned tag the import screen
cannot report success: `card_bip32_import_seed()` returns the authentikey and
the view unpacks it as `(response, sw1, sw2)`, so a successful import is what
raises `TypeError`. The card is seeded either way. The check is there so that the
day upstream fixes it, this fails and says so.

**`test_cards_seedkeeper.py`** -- the two flows the SeedSigner+ Smartcard is sold
for, on a **SeedKeeper**, end to end through the wallet's own screens: scan the
BIP39 test vector, save it to a blank card (which the wallet initialises with a
PIN on the way), discard it from the wallet entirely, and load it back off the
card.

Three oracles, and they are independent. The card announces what it stored and
what it exported, from the Python side of the APDU boundary, and the type,
subtype, label and length it reports have to be the `Masterseed` layout the wallet
claims to write. The wallet announces the screens it reached, and getting to the
seed screen at all means pysatochip recovered the card's authentikey from the
signature over the header and the secret, because it raises rather than returning
if it cannot. And the seed the wallet ends up holding is compared, as a digest of
the device canvas, against the one it held after the scan earlier in the same
run: one seed, in by camera and back off a card, on one rendered screen. The
digest is taken from the canvas rather than from a screenshot so that nothing
about the surrounding page or its fonts can enter into it.

It also reloads the page at the end and requires three factory-fresh SeedKeepers,
because card state living only in memory is a decision rather than an oversight.

**`test_cards_seedkeeper_descriptor.py`** -- the other flow the card is sold for,
a **multisig wallet descriptor** travelling on a SeedKeeper instead of being
scanned. Half of it works, and this file is where the halves are separated.

A 2 of 3 over three published BIP39 vectors goes in by camera, so `2 of 3` and
three fingerprints on the wallet's own screen say embit really parsed it. Then
*Save MultiSig Descriptor* is driven to the end: the wallet puts a PIN on the
blank card, and the card announces what it was handed -- secret type `0xC1`, the
label the wallet asked for, and 450 bytes for a 448-character descriptor, which
is the two-byte length a v2 card's layout puts in front of it. The wallet reaches
its own Success screen and no warning goes up on the way.

*Load MultiSig Descriptor* then hits a wall that is upstream's and has nothing to
do with which pysatochip is shipped. Every view that reads a SeedKeeper's headers
by name uses `SEEDKEEPER_DIC_TYPE`, and `smartcard_views.py` imports it inside a
`try`/`except ImportError` together with three modules that exist in no published
pysatochip, so the import always fails and every name in it stays undefined. The
screen raises `NameError: name 'SEEDKEEPER_DIC_TYPE' is not defined` and puts
that sentence up. The checks are that the warning is what happens, that **the
card was never asked for the descriptor** and that it refused nothing, so what is
being asserted is the wallet's failure rather than the simulator's. The three
missing modules are checked out of the wallet zip in the same run, so the reason
is evidence and not a story.

This file used to assert that *both* screens were blocked, by
`KeyError: 'Descriptor'`, and that half was ours: PyPI's pysatochip 0.17.0 has no
name for `0xC1` and the device does not use PyPI. See the pysatochip note in
`build/build-wallet-zip.sh`. Everything the card end needs is proved next door in
`test_cards.py`: the same descriptor stored as type `0xC1`, read back byte for
byte, its header parsed by pysatochip and its cost checked against upstream's own
size arithmetic. On the day upstream fixes that import, the load check fails and
says so.

**`test_mainnet.py`** -- mainnet, on purpose. The simulator ships on Testnet and
the page shouts when anybody moves it to Mainnet, because a seed typed into a
browser tab has no secure element. That warning is only honest if mainnet
actually works here, so this is the file that checks it, and it costs nothing: no
coins, no network, nothing broadcast.

The device is taken to Mainnet through Settings > Advanced, the published test
seed goes in by camera, and an account key comes back out through the wallet's
own Export Xpub screens at both standard mainnet paths: `m/48'/0'/0'/2'` for
multisig and `m/84'/0'/0'` for single sig. What the wallet drew is read out of the
QR on its screen and compared, fingerprint and all 111 characters of the key,
against a key derived in `mainnet_reference.py`. The wallet does all of its work
with embit; that file never imports embit and never opens a wallet zip, so
agreement is two implementations that share no code arriving at the same key
rather than one library agreeing with itself. A wallet still deriving under coin
type `1'` would fail here on the origin alone.

Then a mainnet transaction the test fabricates: an invented UTXO on a transaction
that does not exist, spent to an address nobody holds the key to. It goes in as a
base64 PSBT by camera, the wallet is driven through its own review and approve
screens, and the signed PSBT is read back off the animated QR it displays. The
signature is then checked offline against a BIP143 sighash computed from the
transaction the test built: under the key at `m/84'/0'/0'/0/0` and no other,
committed to SIGHASH_ALL, low-S, and over the transaction that went in byte for
byte. Two of the checks are the verifier proving it can say no -- the same
signature with one bit changed, and the same signature against the sighash of a
transaction paying a different amount -- because a verifier that says yes to
everything would have passed the line above them.

The reel in front of the camera is changed between the seed scan and the PSBT
scan. Chromium reopens the y4m file when a stream starts, which was measured
rather than assumed, so replacing it between two scans is what holding up a
different QR looks like from the wallet's side.

Smartcard firmware only. Both firmwares carry the same embit, and neither the
export screens nor the signing path is card code, so a second run would spend
minutes proving the same thing again.

## `test_tutorial.py`: the multisig tutorial, without a network

Three things about the tutorial can be checked offline, and one cannot.

**The coordinator on the page computes the right things.** Nothing in
`src/web/signet-coordinator.js` is shared with the wallet: it is a second
implementation of BIP32 public derivation, sortedmulti, P2WSH, bech32 and
BIP174, written for the browser. So every value it produces is compared against
**embit**, taken out of the wallet zip, which is the library the device parses
these with: the 2 of 3 descriptor, the first receive address, the change
address, the witness script behind them, and the id of the finished
transaction. embit also signs the coordinator's own PSBT with two of the three
test seeds, so the finishing half is exercised with signatures the coordinator
did not make. Two implementations agreeing is worth something; one agreeing with
itself is not. In the same pass, every code the phone holds up is drawn by
`qr-encode.js` and read back by jsQR, which is the pair the device's camera path
actually uses.

**Hands on mode works.** The test presses the buttons itself, in the order the
panel asks for them, and checks the panel moves on only when the thing it asked
for has happened. It also hands back mid-step and checks the run finishes the
card on its own, which is the claim that the two modes are one machine. The
progress line is checked to be absent while the visitor is driving and back when
it is not.

**Self driving runs at reading speed, and the visitor can stop it.** The whole
ceremony used to go past in two minutes, about a third of a second per
instruction, so the run now waits for what it has just said to be read. The test
times three consecutive instructions and requires the panel to be moving slower
than that; then it pauses mid-run and checks nothing moves for eight seconds and
the progress line keeps what has already happened, presses Step and checks
exactly one action goes by before it stops again, and presses Play and checks it
carries on. The failure states below then run on that same page with the reading
pauses turned off from the test, because getting to the faucet means driving six
card steps first and every pause on the way is one this file has just measured.

**The failure states are designed.** Bitsaga Signet is broken in the three ways
it can be broken, from the test rather than from the page: the faucet answers
"empty", the request is refused outright, and the request is never answered at
all. Each has to reach a red verdict saying so in words, with a way out, and
each is photographed. The last one is why the coordinator gives up on a request
after twenty seconds: a call that never answers would otherwise leave the panel
waiting for ever with nothing on screen to say so.

It finishes at 360 pixels wide, open drawers and all, and fails if anything
pushes the page sideways.

What it cannot prove is that a spend confirms on a real chain.

## `test_tutorial_live.py`: and with one

Run it against the deployed site with `--deployed`, which turns both pieces of
scaffolding off: nothing is served from this checkout and the broadcast goes to
the real endpoint. That is the run worth trusting before a release, and it is how
the 2 of 3 confirmed in block 1125 was driven.


Not in `run.py`, and not run by CI: it needs the network, it needs Bitsaga
Signet to be up, and it waits for real blocks. It drives the whole tutorial self
driving, follows the panel's own step titles, refuses any red verdict, and at
the end asks Bitsaga Signet's proof endpoint whether the transaction the panel
says it sent is in a block.

Two pieces of scaffolding, both in `signet_bridge.py`. The page is served **at
https://bitsaga.be**, which is the only browser origin that API allows, by
answering that origin from the local server with the two isolation headers; the
page is this checkout and every call to `signet.bitsaga.be` goes to the real
host. And `POST /api/broadcast` is answered by the test, because that endpoint
does not exist on the server yet: it hands the transaction to Fulcrum with the
same Electrum call the endpoint would use, so the broadcast is real.
[`docs/SIGNET-API.md`](../docs/SIGNET-API.md) is the endpoint to add. That
server does not listen on anything public, so `SIGNET_ELECTRUM=host:port` has to
be set to run this file, and where it does listen is deliberately not written
down in this repository.

## Supporting files

- `harness.py`: where to point the tests, and the log reader they share.
- `mainnet_reference.py`: the other side of every comparison `test_mainnet.py`
  makes. BIP39, BIP32, SLIP-132, BIP143 and ECDSA verification written out from
  the specifications, plus RIPEMD-160, which OpenSSL 3 hides behind its legacy
  provider and so cannot be relied on from `hashlib`. Runnable on its own
  (`python3 test/mainnet_reference.py`), which prints the published vectors it is
  anchored to: BIP32's test vector 1, one of BIP39's, and RIPEMD-160's own.
- `serve.py`: a static server that sends COOP and COEP. Without cross-origin
  isolation `SharedArrayBuffer` is not constructible and the wallet hangs before
  it draws anything, so `python3 -m http.server` cannot serve this page at all.
  It overlays several directories so a checkout is served without being copied
  anywhere first.
- `make_qr_y4m.py`: writes the `.y4m` videos Chromium's fake camera plays,
  using the wallet's own vendored `qrcode` out of `wallet.zip` so the QR under
  test is drawn by the library SeedSigner draws one with. The seed is the
  standard BIP39 test vector "army van defense …", and the multisig descriptor
  is derived from that vector and two more out of BIP39's own test file, so it
  is visibly three published seeds rather than a string somebody typed. Nothing
  about any of them is secret and nothing should ever hold value.
- `run.py`: the runner described above.
