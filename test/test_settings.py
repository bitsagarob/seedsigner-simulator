"""
Change a setting through the wallet's own menus and see that it takes.

This exists because it did not, and nothing here noticed. Settings.save()
debounces its write behind a threading.Timer, the worker shimmed Thread but not
Timer, and so every settings change died on a System Error screen: the network
selector among them, which is the first thing anyone testing against a test
network has to touch. Fifteen tests passed throughout.

The wallet's settings live in an in-memory filesystem, so nothing here survives
a reload, and that is the point: this asks whether the change works at all, not
whether it persists.

It also checks the network indicator under the device and the two halves of the
warning above it, and this is the file to check them in: neither is worth
anything unless it follows a change made through the wallet's own menus, which is
what the route below is.
