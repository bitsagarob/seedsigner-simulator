Drive the simulated card registry the way pysatochip does, without a browser.

This is the fast half of the smartcard story: no Pyodide, no page, just the
pyscard stand-in in src/smartcard being asked the same questions the wallet asks
it. If this fails, test_cards_browser.py will fail too, and this one says why in
two seconds rather than two minutes.

Both card types are here. A Satochip takes a seed and derives from it; a
SeedKeeper takes labelled secrets and hands them back under whatever export
rights they were stored with. The two answer different AIDs and different
instruction sets, and the checks below are as interested in what each one
refuses as in what it answers.
