"""
The firmware switch: that it switches, and that the page says what it is running.

Two firmwares are built and the page runs one of them, which changes what the
page can honestly show. Stock SeedSigner has no smartcard code at all, so a card
tray under it would be a control for a thing that does not exist, and the
sentence in the technical details panel is where a visitor who followed a shared
link finds out which firmware they are looking at, in full: the switch itself
carries only the name each build calls itself.

Nothing here waits for the wallet to boot: every claim it makes is decided by
the page before Python starts, so this runs in seconds like the tray layout test
rather than in minutes like the ones that drive the wallet.
