"""
Put a seed on a simulated Satochip through the wallet's own screens, and read it
back off the card afterwards.

The tray defaults to a SeedKeeper, so this starts by swapping Card A for a
Satochip -- the type is chosen before the card goes in, because a card is one
thing or the other.

The whole of the save-a-seed path runs here: the wallet initialises a blank card
with a PIN, scans the BIP39 test vector with the camera, hands the seed to the
card, and then -- on a later trip through the menus, with a fresh CardConnector
and a fresh applet selection -- asks the card for extended keys and builds a
descriptor out of what comes back. Nothing between the seed and the descriptor is
faked at a higher level than the APDU.

Two oracles, and they are independent of each other. The card announces the
master fingerprint it derived from the bytes it was handed, which is checkable
against the published test vector; the wallet announces the screens it reached,
and reaching SeedExportXpubDetailsScreen means pysatochip verified both
signatures on every extended key the card answered with, because it raises
rather than returning if it cannot. The screenshots are evidence, not proof.

One assertion here is deliberately an assertion about a bug. The import screen
cannot report success at the pinned tag:

    File "seedsigner/views/smartcard_views.py", line 3643, in run
      _resp, sw1, sw2 = Satochip_Connector.card_bip32_import_seed(...)
    TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable ECPubkey object

CardConnector.card_bip32_import_seed() returns the card's authentikey, not a
(response, sw1, sw2) triple -- that is the Keycard backend's signature, and
ToolsSatochipImportSeedView unpacks every backend's return value the same way.
So on a Satochip it is a *successful* import that raises. Nothing here works
around it: the card is seeded either way, because the APDU succeeded before the
wallet mishandled the answer, and the rest of this test goes on to use it. It is
present on upstream's dev tip too, so it is not something a newer pin fixes.

The seed is the standard BIP39 test vector "army van defense ...", the same one
the scan tests hold up. Nothing about it is secret and nothing should ever hold
value.
