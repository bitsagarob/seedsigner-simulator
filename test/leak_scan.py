"""
Fail if a tracked file leaks the author's infrastructure.

This repo is published from a working machine that also runs other things. The
risk is not a stolen key -- it is the boring stuff: a hardcoded home directory
naming the account, a private address naming the subnet, an internal hostname
naming a box. None of it is dangerous on its own, and all of it is free
reconnaissance for anyone who wants to go looking.

A human can spot that once. A human cannot spot it on every commit forever, so
it is checked here instead, and it fails the build rather than warning.

What is deliberately NOT checked: public URLs. github.com/<the project> is meant
to be in this repo, and a scanner that bans the word "github" would be turned off
within a week. Everything below matches a shape that only ever appears by
accident -- a private address, somebody's home directory, a name that resolves
nowhere outside one LAN.

Run it directly (python3 test/leak_scan.py) or let run.py do it first.
