"""
Six simulated smartcards -- a SeedKeeper and a Satochip for each of three tray
slots -- and the one reader they go in and out of.

Browsers have no smartcard API at all, so the only honest place to fake a card is
the transport. pysatochip reaches a physical card through pyscard, and this module
replaces that layer with cards implemented in Python. Everything above it, the
whole of pysatochip and the whole of SeedSigner, runs unmodified against them,
which is the point: the demo exercises the real flows rather than a mock of them.

Two applets, because they are two different products and the wallet talks to them
differently. A Satochip holds one BIP32 master key and derives from it; a
SeedKeeper holds a list of labelled secrets and hands them back. Each answers its
own AID and its own instruction set, and neither answers the other's, which is how
CardConnector.card_select() settles on the right one.

There are three slots because a user needs to be able to tell one card from
another -- put a seed on Card A, check Card B is still blank, come back to Card A
and find it as it was left. Each slot holds one card of each type: swapping the
type in the tray is swapping the card, so the two have different CINs and so
different UIDs, and each keeps its own state while the other is out.

Each card starts blank, with nothing on it and setup not done, so the wallet
drives its own initialisation flow instead of a shortcut.

Cards live in CARDS, a module-level registry, so their state survives connect and
disconnect the way a card taken out of a reader and put back would.

Which card is in the reader, and which type it is, comes from the page through the
SharedArrayBuffer set up by install(). Reading it is what makes an empty reader an
empty reader: with nothing inserted, waiting for a card times out and transmitting
raises, exactly as they do when there is no card in a real one.
