# --- one upstream bug, put back from outside ---------------------------------
# ShieldSigner B11 -- the tag UPSTREAM pins, and the tag the official
# pi0-smartcard image is built from -- calls _format_word_password() in
# password_generator_views.py without importing it. The name is defined in
# tools_views.py and never brought across, so every word-based password ends in
# a System Error naming line 893 instead of a password. It is nothing to do with
# the dice it was first reported from: EFF short, EFF long and BIP39 all reach
# the same line, whatever the entropy came from. Real B11 hardware has it too.
#
# From outside, and only where the name is missing. The wallet zip stays the
# pinned tree byte for byte -- that is the claim this repository exists to let
# anyone check -- so this is replaced the way every other seam here is, from
# this side of the boundary rather than by editing the tree. Upstream's own
# master fixes it with exactly this import, so the guard turns this into a
# no-op the day UPSTREAM can move to a tag that carries the fix. There is no
# such tag yet: B11 is the newest one published.
#
# tools_views first, and that order is load bearing. The two modules import each
# other: password_generator_views pulls its shared helpers from tools_views at
# the top, and tools_views pulls the password views back in with a star import
# on its last line, which works only because tools_views is the one that gets
# imported first and so is fully defined by the time the star runs. Importing
# password_generator_views first inverts that -- tools_views ends up starring in
# a module that is still executing its own import block -- and the Tools menu
# then dies on "name 'ToolsPasswordGeneratorTypeView' is not defined" before it
# can reach the bug below. Doing it in the order the wallet itself does costs
# nothing and stays out of that.
#
# Broad except on purpose. These are imported lazily by the menu that needs
# them, so a module that fails to import here would take the whole wallet down
# with it, where today it only spoils the one menu.

# --- and a second one, same shape -------------------------------------------

# before the only line that ever assigns it. The assignment is far down the
# success path, after a secret has been exported; the two reads are on the way
# out -- "this card holds nothing I can load", and "back was pressed at the
# secret list" -- so both of the ordinary ways of leaving that screen raise
# AttributeError instead of leaving it. Loading from a freshly initialised card
# is the first one, and it is what a new SeedKeeper does.
#
# Both reads ask the same question, isinstance(self.seed, AezeedSeed), to decide
# whether to return to the aezeed passphrase screen rather than straight back.
# So the attribute is given the value the assignment further down uses, at
# construction, which answers that question correctly in both directions: no
# pending seed is not an AezeedSeed and goes back, and a pending aezeed still
# reaches its passphrase screen. Setting it only when it is missing leaves a
# fixed upstream alone.
#
# Still open on upstream's master, unlike the one above.
