// Matomo, reached through this site's own origin.
//
// The page's content security policy names exactly one host beyond 'self', and
// the page says so to anyone who opens the panel. An analytics host added to
// that list would make that sentence false, and would be the second thing this
// page ever talks to, which is not a trade worth making for a visit count. So
// nothing here is off-origin: the site proxies /mt.js to the Matomo tracker and
// /mt.php to its collector, and to the browser both of them are this site.
//
// Both sit at the site root rather than under the simulator's own directory,
// because that directory is the service worker's scope. A beacon underneath it
// would be intercepted by the offline cache, stored, and served back from the
// cache the next time -- an analytics request that is answered from disk is a
// request that was never made, and one that is replayed is a visit that never
// happened. At the root they are outside the worker's scope entirely and it
// never sees them.
//
// Every path through here is failure tolerant on purpose, because the simulator
// is the point and this is not. A clone of this repository serves no /mt.js,
// nor does a browser with a blocker in front of it: the script never arrives,
// the queue is dropped on the first error, and nothing else on the page can
// tell the difference. Nothing here is on the wallet's critical path either --
// the calls below only ever append to an array or hand a URL to an image.
