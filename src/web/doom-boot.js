// This is the browser half of seedsigner-os/boot-game, where the image boots a
// game and KEY1, KEY2, KEY3 hands off to SeedSigner with an os.execv, so that no
// game code is left in memory while the signing application is handling keys.
// A tab cannot execv, and the closest thing to it is this: DOOM is stopped and
// dropped before the wallet is asked for, and the wallet's 26MB of Pyodide is
// never fetched at all until somebody spells the sequence.
//
// That last part is why the browser version is worth more than the joke. The
// page used to spend about forty seconds booting CPython in WebAssembly before
// it drew anything, on every visit, for everyone. Now the device is playable in
// about a second and only the people who came for a wallet pay for one.
//
// What this module does NOT do is choose a game. On the device a chooser
// appears when more than one game is installed; here exactly one is, so the
// page boots straight into it and there is no menu between DOOM and the wallet.
//
// DOOM itself is not here. It arrives as a wrapper defining window.DoomRun (see
// doom-run.js), and everything below is written to survive that wrapper being
// absent, broken, or slow: the unlock is live from the moment this module takes
// the device, whether or not a single frame has ever been drawn. A broken
// easter egg must never stand between somebody and their device, which is the
// rule the device itself is built on.
