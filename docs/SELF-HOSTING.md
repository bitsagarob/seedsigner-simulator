# Self-hosting

Everything here is static files. There is no backend, no database and nothing
running at request time, but there are two headers, and without them the page
loads and then does nothing.

## The one thing that breaks every first attempt

The page **must** be served with both of these:

```http
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

They are what make the document *cross-origin isolated*, which is what makes
`SharedArrayBuffer` constructible. Every input the wallet has (keypresses, camera
frames, the card tray) crosses into the worker on shared memory, because the
worker is blocked inside SeedSigner's main loop and can never answer a
`postMessage` (see
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#the-constraint-everything-follows-from)).
No shared memory, no wallet.

`wallet.html` checks for this before it starts the worker and puts a message on the
page rather than failing silently. If you see

> this page needs cross-origin isolation, which the server is not sending

it is the headers, always. `python3 -m http.server` does not send them, which is
why this repository ships its own server.

The second rule is smaller but just as confusing when you hit it: **the camera
needs a secure context.** That means `https://`, or `http://localhost` /
`http://127.0.0.1`. On a plain `http://` LAN address there is no
`navigator.mediaDevices` to ask, so scanning fails with "no camera API here; needs
https or localhost". Everything else still works.

## Getting the pieces

Two of the three pieces are not in the repository, on purpose: a 26 MB WebAssembly
blob and a wallet you are being asked to trust are both things better fetched and
verified than committed.

```sh
./build/fetch-assets.sh                 # Pyodide 0.26.4 -> src/web/pyodide/, sha256-checked
./build/build-wallet-zip.sh smartcard   # -> build/out/wallet-smartcard.zip, from the pinned commit
./build/build-wallet-zip.sh stock       # -> build/out/wallet-stock.zip, from the pinned commit
```

`fetch-assets.sh --check` re-verifies what is already on disk, and
`sha256sum -c build/checksums.txt` covers everything that is committed and then
served or packaged as it stands: jsQR, the page and its scripts, the icons, the
three shims, and the stand-in packages in `src/smartcard/` and `src/fakes/` that
the build copies into a wallet zip. Both scripts explain their trust chain in
their own header comments; they are worth a read before you run them.

That manifest is generated, by the one command that is allowed to write it:

```sh
./build/update-checksums.sh          # rewrite it, when a change to a listed file is deliberate
./build/update-checksums.sh --check  # is it what it would be? writes nothing
```

Nothing else ever rewrites it. The build reads it and refuses to package a file
that changed or that is listed nowhere; it does not refresh it, because a build
that blessed whatever it found would package a modified simulated card and call
it correct. `CONTRIBUTING.md` has the git hook that keeps a commit from splitting
the two, which is worth installing if you are going to change files here.

## Running it locally

`test/serve.py` overlays several directories into one document root, so a checkout
is served without being copied anywhere first:

```sh
python3 test/serve.py --port 8770 src/web src/shims build/out
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:8770/>. It binds to `127.0.0.1` by default (`--host` to
change that) and sends exactly what the page needs:

```http
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin
Cache-Control: no-store
```

It also serves `.wasm` as `application/wasm`, which Pyodide's streaming
instantiation insists on. `127.0.0.1` is a secure context, so the camera works
there without a certificate.

## Deploying it

A real web server has one document root, so flatten the same three sources into one
directory:

```sh
mkdir -p /srv/seedsigner-simulator
./build/deploy.sh /srv/seedsigner-simulator
```

Use the script rather than copying by hand: it is what keeps a deployment from
going half-copied. `build/check-deploy.sh` then reads the served site back and
reports what does not match this repository.

`src/web/extras/` holds optional features (the MuSig2 coordinator and view),
loaded per firmware by `wallet.html`: a visitor on stock or smartcard fetches
none of them. The stock firmware zip is still verified byte-for-byte against
`UPSTREAM`, so its reproducibility does not depend on what JS ships beside it.

What ends up there, and why each piece has to be exactly where it is (the page,
the worker and the shims all fetch each other by relative path):

| In the served root | From | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `index.html`, `wallet.html` | `src/web/` | landing page and the wallet itself |
| `wallet-worker.js`, `wallet-camera.js`, `wallet-cards.js`, `seedsigner-device.js` | `src/web/` | |
| `jsQR.js` | `src/web/` | must be same-origin; a CDN is refused by both COEP and the page's CSP |
| `sw.js`, `manifest.json`, `icon-*.png`, `apple-touch-icon.png` | `src/web/` | offline cache and PWA install; optional, the wallet runs without them |
| `pyodide/` | `fetch-assets.sh` | ~26 MB: the runtime plus the wheels for Pillow, pycryptodome and cryptography |
| `browser_display.py`, `browser_camera.py`, `browser_qr.py` | `src/shims/` | fetched at boot and written into Pyodide's filesystem |
| `wallet-smartcard.zip`, `wallet-stock.zip` | `build/out/` | one per firmware, each the pinned `seedsigner` tree plus its pure-Python dependencies plus this repository's stand-in packages. Serve both: the page picks one with `?firmware=` |
| `wallet-smartcard.build-info.json`, `wallet-stock.build-info.json` | `build/out/` | what each build is: pin, tag, published hashes, dependency versions. The page's **Technical details** panel is filled from it, and says it cannot describe the build if it is missing |

The shims sit next to the page rather than inside `wallet.zip` deliberately: it
keeps the zip exactly what the build script produced, with the seams visibly
outside it.

## Checking the copy landed, on every box

Copying files into a directory is easy to do halfway, and a half-done copy does
not announce itself: the page still loads, and then reaches for something that
is not there. Three breakages in one day, all that shape. The page was changed
to fetch `wallet-<firmware>.zip` and only the page and the worker were copied,
so the fetch landed on the site's 404 page and Pyodide reported "not a zip
file". Files reached one box and not the other, twice. And a rename turned a URL
a published article tells readers to `curl` into a 404, which matters more than
it sounds: that command is the one thing that proves the served zip is the
pinned build.

`build/check-deploy.sh` asks the four questions those raise, over HTTPS, from
inside each box rather than by reading its disk, because what nginx hands a
visitor is the question:

```sh
./build/check-deploy.sh
```

- is every file in the table above being served, with this repository's bytes?
  The list is worked out from `src/web`, `src/shims` and the firmwares `UPSTREAM`
  publishes a zip hash for, not written down in the script, so a file you add is
  checked without anyone remembering to add it there too.
- do both served zips hash to what `UPSTREAM` publishes, which is what the
  page's technical details panel claims and what a rebuild is compared against?
- does every URL the served pages and scripts name resolve? Including
  `wallet-<firmware>.zip`, whose name the worker builds at runtime, so a rename
  that outran a deploy shows up as a 404 here instead of as a mystery in a
  console.
- do the boxes agree with each other, byte for byte? Two boxes that disagree are
  worse than either being wrong: then what a visitor gets depends on which one
  answered.

It prints PASS or FAIL per item and exits non-zero if anything failed. It only
reports: it deploys nothing and writes nothing anywhere. `SIM_DEPLOY_URL` and
`SIM_DEPLOY_BOXES` point it at your own deployment, a box being `NAME:local` for
the machine you run it on and `NAME:ssh` for one reached with `ssh NAME`.

Two things it does not do, both on purpose. `index.html` is fetched and its
links are followed, but its bytes are not compared: a deployment that writes its
own landing page is doing something reasonable, and a check that failed on that
forever would be a check nobody reads. Everything the wallet itself loads *is*
compared, because a customised one of those is not a re-skin, it is a different
simulator. And `pyodide/` is not hashed file by file: it is 26 MB per box of
somebody else's release, `fetch-assets.sh` already checks it where it is
fetched, and a missing one fails the reference question anyway.

## nginx

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name sim.example.org;

    root /srv/seedsigner-simulator;
    index index.html;

    # Both are required, on every response -- the worker, the wasm and
    # wallet.zip included. Hence `always`.
    add_header Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy   same-origin  always;
    add_header Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy require-corp always;
    add_header Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy same-origin  always;
}
```

Two nginx-specific traps:

- **`add_header` does not inherit into a nested block that has its own.** If any
  `location` in this server adds a header of its own, it drops every `add_header`
  from the parent (including these two), and the page silently loses isolation.
  Repeat them in that location.
- **`.wasm` must be served as `application/wasm`.** Recent `mime.types` include it;
  older ones do not, and Pyodide's streaming compilation refuses the wrong type.
  Check with `curl -I …/pyodide/pyodide.asm.wasm`.

## Caddy

```caddyfile
sim.example.org {
    root * /srv/seedsigner-simulator
    header {
        Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy   same-origin
        Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy require-corp
        Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy same-origin
    }
    file_server
}
```

## Somewhere that cannot set headers

Static hosts that do not let you set response headers (GitHub Pages among them)
cannot serve this page as-is. There are service-worker shims that re-inject
COOP/COEP from inside the browser; this repository does not ship one, and its own
`sw.js` is an offline cache rather than a header trick. Use a host you can
configure.

## Checking it worked

From the outside, before you even open a browser:

```sh
curl -sI https://sim.example.org/wallet.html | grep -i cross-origin
```

In the page's console:

```js
crossOriginIsolated   // must be true
```

Then on the page itself: the status line under the device clears when the wallet
draws its first frame. Add `?debug=1` to the URL (there is a link on the page),
and the console narrates every screen, thread and keypress, plus which QR decoder
the camera settled on.

The test suite can be pointed at a deployment rather than a local checkout, which
is a stronger check than any of the above:

```sh
SIM_URL=https://sim.example.org python3 test/run.py
```

## When it does not work

| What you see | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| "this page needs cross-origin isolation…" | COOP/COEP missing, or dropped by a proxy or a nested `location` |
| Stuck on "loading python…" | `pyodide/` is incomplete or 404ing; check the network tab |
| Stuck on "unpacking wallet…" | `wallet.zip` missing or truncated |
| Wallet draws, but scanning says "no camera API here" | not a secure context: use https or localhost |
| Camera permission prompt never appears | the wallet only opens the camera when you enter a scan screen; that is intended |
| Old wallet, new page, weird errors | a stale service-worker cache; bump `VERSION` in `sw.js` and reload |

## Verifying what you are serving

The point of the pin is that nobody has to take "it is the real firmware" on trust.
Anyone can rebuild and compare:

```sh
./build/build-wallet-zip.sh smartcard
sha256sum build/out/wallet-smartcard.zip
curl -s https://sim.example.org/wallet-smartcard.zip | sha256sum   # must be the same
```

The build is reproducible (fixed timestamps, fixed entry order, nothing about the
build host in the output), so the hashes match or something differs. If they
differ, the script also writes `wallet.zip.manifest`, a `(sha256, path)` line per
file in the zip: diffing two manifests says *which* files differ, and rules out the
boring answer of two zlib versions compressing the same bytes differently.

If you host this for other people, keeping `UPSTREAM` and the served `wallet.zip`
in step is most of your obligation to them: that, and not quietly editing the
`seedsigner` tree inside the zip, because the seams are outside it precisely so
that nobody has to.

## A note on what you are hosting

It is a simulator. Anyone who lands on it should be able to tell that within a few
seconds; both pages here say so, and the wallet page says it again in its "how
this works" panel. If you re-skin it, keep that. A page that runs real SeedSigner
firmware and *looks* like a real wallet is exactly the thing worth not shipping.
