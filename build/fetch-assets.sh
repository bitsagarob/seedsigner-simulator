# It is about 26 MB of prebuilt binaries and it is deliberately not committed:
# a git repository is a bad place for a WASM blob nobody can read, and putting
# it there would invite the reader to trust it because it is "in the repo". It
# is fetched instead, pinned to one release, and checked against a sha256 that
# is written down here in plain sight. A mismatch stops the script; it never
# unpacks something it could not identify.

#
# Trust chain, in the order it is established:
#
#   1. pyodide-core-<version>.tar.bz2 is fetched from the pyodide GitHub
#      release and checked against PYODIDE_CORE_SHA256 below.
#   2. That tarball contains pyodide-lock.json, which lists every package in the
#      distribution with its own sha256. Because the tarball is verified, the
#      lock file is too.
#   3. The handful of compiled packages the wallet needs at runtime (Pillow,
#      pycryptodome, cryptography, and what they depend on) are fetched
#      separately and checked against the hashes in that lock file. No hash for
#      them is written down here, because it does not need to be -- it is
#      already inside something we verified.
#
# Requires: bash, curl, python3, and sha256sum (or shasum).
