# Build DOOM: the boot game the SeedSigner firmware ships, compiled to
# WebAssembly so the simulator can run it.

#   ./build/build-doom-wasm.sh
#   ./build/build-doom-wasm.sh --check      # re-hash what is already on disk
#
# Three files come out, and the script prints a sha256 for each:
#
#   doom.js       the emscripten loader, which defines createDoomModule
#   doom.wasm     the game
#   doom-run.js   the wrapper the page talks to, which defines DoomRun
#
# The WAD is not one of them. Freedoom is nearly 30MB, it is fetched at runtime
# into the module's virtual filesystem rather than linked into the binary, and
# it is content-addressed by its own release; baking it in would triple the
# artifact and make the wasm impossible to compare against anybody else's build.
# The script prints its hash at the end so it can be checked separately.
#
# What "reproducible" means here, honestly:
#
#   * The source is a tree you can read. Nothing in this repository patches
#     DOOM; the port is boot-game/doom/ in seedsigner-os and it is 700 lines of
#     C over an unmodified doomgeneric.
#   * Two builds from the same source, the same doomgeneric commit and the same
#     emscripten release produce the same bytes. That is the comparison the
#     hashes below are for, and it is why the emscripten version is pinned in
#     this file and checked before anything is built.
#   * Change any of those three and the hashes move. A compiler is not a
#     download: a mismatch here means "you built it with something else", not
#     "somebody tampered with it", so a mismatch warns rather than stops.
#
# What the browser sees is what the panel sees. The build reuses ss_video.c
# from the firmware port unmodified, so every frame handed to the page is the
# 240x240 RGB565, big endian, letterboxed picture that goes over SPI to the
# ST7789 on a real device. It is not DOOM rendered nicely for a canvas.
#
# Requires: bash, make, python3, sha256sum (or shasum), and emscripten.
