# Build a wallet zip: the Python tree the simulator unpacks into the Pyodide
# filesystem at runtime.
#
# There are two firmwares and therefore two zips, and the firmware is the one
# required argument:
#
#   ./build/build-wallet-zip.sh smartcard    ->  wallet-smartcard.zip
#   ./build/build-wallet-zip.sh stock        ->  wallet-stock.zip
#
# No default, deliberately. They are equally first-class, they pin different
# repositories, and a script that guessed would eventually hand somebody the
# other one's hash to compare against.
#
# The point of this script is that you do not have to trust the zip that is
# being served to you. Run it, and compare its sha256 to the one you downloaded.
# If they match, the served zip is exactly the pinned upstream SeedSigner tree
# plus the pinned pure-Python dependencies plus this repository's own stand-in
# packages for the hardware it cannot have, and nothing else.
#
#   ./build/build-wallet-zip.sh smartcard
#   sha256sum some-downloaded-wallet-smartcard.zip
#
# For that comparison to mean anything the build has to be reproducible, so:
#
#   * every input is content-addressed -- upstream and the git-pinned
#     dependencies by commit sha, the PyPI dependencies by artifact sha256, and
#     this repository's own stand-in packages by build/checksums.txt;
#   * the zip is written by hand rather than by the zip(1) command, with fixed
#     timestamps (SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH), fixed permissions, fixed entry order, and
#     no __pycache__ or .pyc anywhere;
#   * nothing about the build host leaks in: no paths, no user, no umask, no
#     timezone, no locale.
#
# Two hashes are printed. The first is the sha256 of the zip file, which is what
# you compare against a download. The second is the sha256 of a manifest of
# (sha256, path) over the zip's *contents*, which is independent of how well
# zlib happened to compress. If the zip hashes differ but the manifest hashes
# match, the two builds contain identical files and you are looking at a
# compressor difference, not a supply-chain difference.
#
# Requires: bash, git, curl, python3, and sha256sum (or shasum).

Usage: build-wallet-zip.sh FIRMWARE [options]

  FIRMWARE         Which wallet to build, and which section of UPSTREAM to read
                   its pin from. One of:
                     smartcard   the 3rdIteration fork, with SeedKeeper and
                                 Satochip support   ->  wallet-smartcard.zip
                     stock       SeedSigner as its own project publishes it
                                                    ->  wallet-stock.zip

  --out DIR        Write the zip here (default: <repo>/build/out)
  --cache DIR      Cache downloaded PyPI artifacts here
                   (default: $XDG_CACHE_HOME/seedsigner-sim-build)
  --no-cache       Download everything fresh, cache nothing
  --keep-staging   Leave the assembled tree in the output directory, for
                   diffing against an unpacked wallet zip
  -h, --help       This message

Environment:
  SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH   Timestamp stamped into every zip entry. Defaults to the
                      commit date of the pinned upstream commit, so two people
                      who run this with no environment set get the same bytes.
  SS_REPO             Build from this clone URL instead of the pinned one.
  SS_COMMIT           Build from this commit, branch or tag instead of the pin.

                      Either or both, for testing your own SeedSigner fork in
                      the simulator. The zip you get will not hash to what
                      UPSTREAM publishes, because it is not that build, and it
                      says so in wallet-FIRMWARE.build-info.json and in the
                      page's technical details panel. See CONTRIBUTING.md.

# The dependency pins
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Upstream pins its Python dependencies in requirements.txt, some as PyPI
# versions and some as git or GitHub-archive URLs. Those pins are reproduced
# below, one row per dependency, in a form this script can act on.
#
# We do not shell out to pip. pip resolves, it does not just fetch: given the
# same requirements file on two machines it can pick different artifacts, it
# runs setup.py out of sdists (arbitrary code, arbitrary output), and it writes
# .dist-info directories whose contents depend on the pip and setuptools
# versions installed. None of that survives a byte-for-byte comparison. What we
# want is the narrow thing pip would be used for here: fetch one exact artifact,
# check it is the artifact we meant, unpack the pure-Python module out of it.
# That is what the table below describes, and it is auditable by reading it --
# every byte that enters the build is named and hashed here.
#
# Columns, pipe-separated:
#
#   kind      pypi (fetch an artifact by URL, verify sha256)
#             git  (clone and check out a commit, verified by git itself)
#   module    what lands at the top level of the zip: a package directory or a
#             single .py file
#   dist      distribution name, used to name its licence file
#   release   version, or the commit for git pins
#   url       artifact URL, or clone URL
#   integrity sha256 of the artifact, or the full commit sha
#   subpath   directory inside the unpacked source that contains `module`
#
# One table per firmware, because the two firmwares pin different sets: the
# smartcard fork needs the whole card stack, stock needs three libraries. They
# are written out separately rather than expressed as a base plus a delta. Two
# lists a reader can check line by line against two requirements.txt files beat
# a mechanism that computes the same lists and has to be understood first.
#
# EXPECTED_TOP_LEVEL beside each is everything that must be at the top level of
# the finished zip, and nothing else. Checked before the zip is written, so a
# dependency that silently failed to unpack stops the build instead of shipping
# a wallet that cannot import.

#
# The two are not the same code. That GitHub tag calls itself pysatochip 0.17.4
# in its own version.py, four revisions past the newest release on PyPI, and one
# of those revisions is "correct handling of Password, Descriptor and Data
# secret types in seedkeeper export": its SEEDKEEPER_DIC_TYPE has
# 0xC1: 'Descriptor' and PyPI 0.17.0 has no entry for that type at all. Shipping
# the PyPI one gave this simulator a descriptor failure that does not exist on
# the device, which is precisely the kind of lie a simulator must not tell. So
# the row below is the tag, pinned by commit like every other git row here.
# Stock has no card code and no pysatochip, so none of this touches its build.

# The two are not the same code. That GitHub tag calls itself pysatochip 0.17.4
# in its own version.py, four revisions past the newest release on PyPI, and one
# of those revisions is "correct handling of Password, Descriptor and Data
# secret types in seedkeeper export": its SEEDKEEPER_DIC_TYPE has
# 0xC1: 'Descriptor' and PyPI 0.17.0 has no entry for that type at all. Shipping
# the PyPI one gave this simulator a descriptor failure that does not exist on
# the device, which is precisely the kind of lie a simulator must not tell. So
# the row below is the tag, pinned by commit like every other git row here.
# Stock has no card code and no pysatochip, so none of this touches its build.

#       imports it at module scope with no try/except, so the import has to
#       succeed: src/fakes/pyzbar is staged below and browser_camera.py replaces
#       the one function that would have called it. The smartcard fork guards
#       the same import and therefore needs no such file.
#
# The other three are pinned here. embit and qrcode are the same artifacts, at
# the same versions and the same sha256, that the smartcard table pins, because
# both firmwares pin the same two versions.
#
# urtypes is the one place the two firmwares genuinely disagree. The fork pins a
# selfcustody git commit; stock pins PyPI 1.0.1. Their trees differ by a single
# line, `from .crypto import *` in __init__.py, which PyPI 1.0.1 has and the
# pinned commit does not. Reusing the fork's pin would have built and probably
# run, and it would also have meant this zip was not the thing stock's
# requirements.txt names. Each firmware gets the pin its own upstream published.

# 3. This repository's stand-in packages
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Each one shadows a module the wallet imports and this environment cannot
# provide. They are top-level entries in the zip for exactly that reason:
# /wallet is first on sys.path, so the import in unmodified SeedSigner code
# finds ours. Which ones are staged is the firmware's business, and the list was
# chosen above:
#
#   smartcard  the simulated SeedKeeper and Satochip, shadowing pyscard. Only
#              the fork has card code to import it.
#   RPi        an import stand-in for RPi.GPIO. Only stock imports it unguarded.
#   pyzbar     an import stand-in for the zbar binding, for the same reason.
#
# Nothing the other firmware never imports is shipped to it. A zip whose claim
# is "the pin, its pinned dependencies and this repository's stand-ins, and
# nothing else" should not carry a package that is dead on arrival.
#
# Each one is checked against build/checksums.txt before it is copied, so that
# last clause names a specific set of bytes rather than whatever the working tree
# happened to hold. It is the same manifest build/fetch-assets.sh --check reads,
# and the same two questions: does every file hash to what it should, and is
# every file in the directory listed at all.

# 8. What this build is, written down for the page
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The simulator shows a visitor what it is running: the firmware, the pin it
# came from, the hashes to compare against, what the zip carries and which
# Pyodide interprets it. That description has to be produced by the build, not
# maintained beside it, or it becomes one more thing that can drift and be wrong
# exactly when someone is checking. Every field below is read out of UPSTREAM,
# out of the dependency table in this file, or out of build/fetch-assets.sh.
#
# Beside the zip and not inside it: the zip's bytes are the thing being
# compared, and nothing added here may touch them.
#
# The two hashes are the ones UPSTREAM publishes, deliberately, rather than the
# ones this run just printed. They are what a reader is asked to compare
# against, so a build that stopped reproducing has to show up as a mismatch on
# the page rather than quietly publishing whatever it produced.
#
# Which is also what makes an SS_REPO/SS_COMMIT override announce itself with no
# special case: the published hashes stay published hashes, the zip beside them
# is a different zip, and the page's own check compares the two and puts up "the
# wallet zip this page loaded is not the published build" in as many words. The
# three fields below add what that verdict cannot say on its own -- that the
# difference is an override rather than tampering, and what it was built from.
#
# A build from the pin writes exactly the bytes it wrote before this existed.
# Nothing is added to describe a build that has not changed, so a deployment does
# not have to be touched for a firmware nobody rebuilt.
