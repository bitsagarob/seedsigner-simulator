# This is the only thing in the repository that writes that file. The build does
# not, the test suite does not, the git hook does not: a manifest that a build
# updates for you is a manifest that blesses whatever it finds, and the whole
# reason this one exists is that a modified simulated card has to fail loudly
# rather than quietly produce a different zip. So the bookkeeping is one command
# a person runs on purpose, and the diff it produces is the record that somebody
# meant it. Everything else only ever reads and compares.
#
# --check writes nothing either. It regenerates into memory and diffs, so it can
# be run from a hook or from CI without any chance of the check editing the thing
# it is checking.
#
# The file is generated whole, prose included. If you want to change what it says
# about itself, change the here-documents below; an edit made in checksums.txt
# would be overwritten the next time somebody runs this, and --check would call
# it a mismatch in the meantime.

Usage: update-checksums.sh [--check | --list] [--root DIR]

  (no option)  Rewrite build/checksums.txt from the files it covers
  --check      Report whether build/checksums.txt is already what this would
               write, and exit non-zero if it is not. Writes nothing.
  --list       Print the paths this covers, one per line, and exit
  --root DIR   Look at DIR instead of this checkout. For checking a tree that
               is not the working tree -- the git hook materialises the staged
               tree and points this at that.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What the manifest covers
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Directories, not files, and every file found in them. That is the point: the
# four files added to src/web in one afternoon reached a deployment while the
# manifest still described the set from that morning, and a list of names would
# have gone stale exactly the same way. A directory cannot.
#
# src/web and src/shims are what a visitor is served as it stands. src/smartcard
# and src/fakes are copied whole into a wallet zip by build/build-wallet-zip.sh,
# so a file added to one of them changes that zip's hash.
#
# Excluded: src/web/pyodide-e24b45d3, which is 26 MB of fetched runtime that
# build/fetch-assets.sh hash-checks where it fetches it and .gitignore keeps out
# of the repository, and __pycache__, which is generated and which the build
# refuses to package anyway.
#
# DOOM is excluded for the same reason and it matters more here, because these
# land in src/web itself rather than in a directory of their own: doom.js,
# doom.wasm and doom-run.js are built by build/build-doom-wasm.sh from a pinned
# doomgeneric, and the WAD is fetched from Freedoom's own release. Both are
# hash-checked where they are produced and both are gitignored. Left in, this
# manifest would say one thing on a machine that had built the game and another
# on a machine that had not, which is the one thing a manifest may never do.
# doom-boot.js is not excluded: it is this repository's own source.

#
# Generated by build/update-checksums.sh, which is the only thing that writes
# it. No build and no hook ever rewrites this file: one that a build could
# refresh would bless whatever it found, and an unexpected change here is
# supposed to stop somebody rather than be tidied away. Regenerating is a
# command a person runs, and the diff is the evidence they meant it.
#
# Everything fetched is already content-addressed where it is fetched: the wallet
# and its Python dependencies by build/build-wallet-zip.sh, the Pyodide runtime
# by build/fetch-assets.sh. This file is the other half, the files that live in
# the repository and are served or packaged as they are. Without it "you can read
# all of it" is a claim about a moving target; with it, a change to any of them
# is a line in a diff that somebody had to write on purpose.
#
# Check them from the repository root with any of:
#
#     sha256sum -c build/checksums.txt          # the hashes below
#     ./build/fetch-assets.sh --check           # and that nothing is missing from them
#     ./build/update-checksums.sh --check       # and that this file is what it would be
#
# When a change to one of these files is deliberate, regenerate this file in the
# same commit as the change:
#
#     ./build/update-checksums.sh
#
# Both directions are checked, because they are the same mistake: a file that
# changed and a file that was added and listed nowhere both reach a visitor
# unannounced. build/build-wallet-zip.sh asks both questions of the packaged
# directories below before it stages either into a zip, and refuses to package a
# file that is not listed here at all.

# Served as they stand. src/web is the page, its scripts and its icons; src/shims

# says nothing about any of them, and they are the code that decides what the

# jsQR 1.4.0, Apache-2.0, is the file published as dist/jsQR.js in the npm
