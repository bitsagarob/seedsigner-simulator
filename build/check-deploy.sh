# Compare what a deployment actually serves with what this repository says it

#
#   ./build/check-deploy.sh
#
# This exists because a deployment here is a copy of files into a directory on
# more than one machine, and a copy is easy to do halfway. Three ways it went
# wrong in one day, all of which this catches:
#
#   * the page was changed to fetch wallet-<firmware>.zip and only the page and
#     the worker were copied, so the fetch landed on the site's 404 page and
#     Pyodide reported "not a zip file". Nothing said so until somebody looked;
#   * files reached one box and not the other, twice, so which copy a visitor
#     got depended on which box answered;
#   * a rename turned a URL a published article tells readers to curl into a
#     404, which is worse than it sounds: that command is the one thing that
#     proves the served zip is the pinned build.
#
# So there are four questions here, and each is asked of every box:
#
#   1. is every file the page needs there, and are its bytes this repository's?
#   2. does every served zip hash to what UPSTREAM publishes?
#   3. does every URL the served pages and scripts name actually resolve?
#   4. do the boxes serve the same bytes as each other?
#
# Each box is asked over HTTPS from inside itself (curl --resolve to loopback),
# not by reading its filesystem: what is on disk is not the question, what nginx
# hands a visitor is. That also means a vhost pointed at the wrong directory, or
# a file the web server cannot read, shows up here.
#
# Requires: bash, curl, sha256sum (or shasum), and ssh to any box that is not
# this one. No venv, nothing to install, nothing to build -- except the
# build-info.json files, which are build output and are compared against
# build/out. Run build/build-wallet-zip.sh first, or those report that they have
# nothing to compare against.
#
# Pyodide is deliberately not compared byte for byte: it is 26 MB per box of
# somebody else's release, build/fetch-assets.sh already hash-checks it where it
# is fetched, and an absent or half-copied one shows up in question 3 anyway,
# because the worker names pyodide/pyodide.js.

#
# This is the deploy table in docs/SELF-HOSTING.md, worked out rather than
# written down. It used to be a hardcoded list, and on the day four files were
# added to src/web it went on checking the fifteen it knew about: they were
# served, and this said everything was fine. A check that silently ignores a new
# file is the failure it exists to prevent, so the set is derived from the same
# three places a deploy copies from -- src/web, src/shims, and one zip and one
# build-info per firmware in UPSTREAM. Add a file to src/web and it is checked;
# add a third firmware to UPSTREAM and it is checked; nobody edits this script.
#
# Columns, pipe-separated:
#
#   served    the path under the site URL
#   source    what in this repository it must equal, if anything
#   mode      repo      byte identical to `source`
#             upstream  hash equal to the [SECTION] wallet_zip_sha256 in
#                       UPSTREAM, named in `source` -- the zips are build
#                       output, so UPSTREAM is what publishes them and what a
#                       visitor is asked to compare against
#             local     may be a deployment's own, so it is not compared to the
#                       repository; it still has to be there, its references
#                       still have to resolve, and the boxes still have to agree
#
# index.html is the one `local` row, and stays one however this list is derived.
# bitsaga.be serves its own landing page there, on purpose, and a check that
# failed on that forever would be a check nobody reads. Everything the wallet
# itself loads is `repo`: a customised one of those is not a re-skin, it is a
# different simulator.
#
# src/web/pyodide is skipped for the reason in the header: 26 MB per box of
# somebody else's release, hash-checked where it is fetched, and an absent one
# shows up in question 3 anyway.
